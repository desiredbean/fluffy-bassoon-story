There was a badger named Bucky Badger. He
was starting his first year at a far away
place called UW-Madison. He has heard rumors
that the students there loved ice cream, going 
to concerts on the terrace, and had an annual
snow ball fight on bascom hill. This story starts
with Bucky Badger's first week of school...
(Nikh): After moving into his dorm and meeting 
his new roommate, Bucky decided to visit Picnic point.
He had heard a lot about the beauty the location and 
wanted to look at it with his own two eyes. He 
decided to bike down to the entrance and then 
walked the rest of the distance. When he finally 
reached the place, he was astounded by how pretty the 
lake looked.
(Hari): It was then a loud grumble came from his belly and
he realized how hungry he felt. Bucky had heard good things 
about the food at Memorial Union and decided to make the
trek over there. He was greeted to several choices of what he
could eat. While looking around he finally ended up at Strada and 
resolved to get a delicious pizza.
